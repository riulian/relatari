Project for Gym and yoga studio for teachers and for
students with different levels of access using Devise with little personification
(students are guests and teachers are admins). I used bootstrap for View and
jQuery in some Views. I used 5 relational tables . Students who are logged in,
can make confessions with spiritual experiences and they will have various
specificities: love, courage, discernment. Then anyone can look for different
spiritual experiences that have a certain specificity, for example courage. etc
